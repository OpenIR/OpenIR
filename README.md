# OpenIR
Open Source and Cross Platform Infrared Analyzer, Decoder and Sender

This project is inspired by Analysir, a very similar project which is 
maintained commercially (non - open source). The need for an open-source,
community driven alternative resulted in the commencement of this project.
Another important factor for beginning this project was the need for a cross
platform alternative.

## Objective
- **Community Driven:** This project aims to remain free, open-source and
 community driven. One of the main reasons for taking this approach is the
 realization that most of the target audience includes tinkerers and hackers
 using the Arduino platform, a platform that consolidates solely of open source
 software and hardware. As such, I think it only makes sense that those that
 use the Arduino platform are looking for or prefer an open source solution to
 their problems, albeit a solution which is on par with any commerical
 alternative.

- **Cross Platform:** This project places cross platform support at the forefront
 of its goals. Unlike Analysir, OpenIR strives to work on different platforms
 and operating systems to contribute to the truly open and free concept.

## TODO
- Create communication interface between device and OpenIR
- Create OpenIR User Interface
- Create "Custom IR" standard that creates a layer of standardization between
 different IR protocols, making development much easier.
